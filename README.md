# CalculatorðŸ§®
Hey I just started my Python journey.
This is a basic calculator program using python.

This Python program takes a user input mathematical expression, parses it, and evaluates the result.
It supports basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /, %) and uses the "=" sign to indicate the end of the calculation.

Usage:
1. Enter a valid mathematical expression, e.g., "2*45*67-5=".
2. The program will parse the input, evaluate the expression, and display the result.
3. Process the expression following the left-to-right precedence of operations.
